[h3] AbsoluteZinema mod allows game to render more tiles when zoom out. [/h3]
[h3] This mod could be useful for those who wanna see more blocks (and have powerful pc). [/h3]

[h3]How to use:[/h3]
For now you should use other mods to alter the scale.
I'd recommend BetterZoom mod for zooming out camera.

[h3]Mod Config:[/h3]
You can change rendering area by changing MinScale parameter in mod preferences.
The MinScale can be set in range [0.4, 1.0], but it's not recommented to make it too low
cause it may lead to performance issues.
