AbsoluteZinema mod allows game to render more tiles when zoom out. This mod could be useful for those who wanna see more blocks (and have powerful pc).
For now you should use other mods to alter the scale.

You can change rendering area by changing MinScale parameter in mod preferences.

Source code of that mod is available on GitHub: https://github.com/DogeRoll/AbsoluteZinema
