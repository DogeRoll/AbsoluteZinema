AbsoluteZinema mod allows game to render more tiles when zoom out.
This mod could be useful for those who wanna see more blocks (and have powerful pc).

[c/FF4F4F:WARNING:] Mod is not compatible with Better Zoom and may not be compatible with other graphical mods.
If u want it to be compatible with other mods ask in the "Compatibility Requests" thread on mod page in steam.

[c/FFE900:How to use:]
Set required zoom and rendering options in config and change scale in general options.

[c/FFE900:Mod Config:]
You can change rendering area and scale by changing scaling parameter in mod preferences.
The Min. Scale and Min. Zoom options can be set in range [40, 100], but it's not recommented to make Min. Scale too low cause it may lead to performance issues.
By default both parameters are equal, but you can set different values by changing "Same as Zoom" option in config.
